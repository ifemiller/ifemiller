### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I'm Ife (E-Fay), a data enthusiast transitioning into the data field from pharmaceutical manufacturing compliance. 



My GitHub is just me tinkering away at datasets I find interesting and practicing using unfamiliar Python packages to clean, explore, analyze, and visualize data. 



Currently: 
  Completing a Udemy Python course that I picked to learn more about OOP and API's for a webscraping project I'd like to start
  Completing my [Anaplan](https://www.anaplan.com/platform/planning-and-modeling/) Level 2 Model Builder Certification
 
Aside from that, I love to travel and I'm a huge foodie :yum:
