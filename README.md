### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I'm Ife (E-Fay), a data enthusiast transitioning into the data field from pharmaceutical manufacturing compliance. I have just completed Correlation One's Data Science for All/Empowerment program, a 13 week intensive where I became more confident using Python and was introduced to SQL. My GitHub is just me tinkering away at datasets I find interesting and practicing using unfamiliar Python packages to clean, explore, analyze, and visualize data. In my free time I am studying and completing online courses to feel more confident in applying new knowledge to small projects I can share here!

Aside from that, I love to travel and I'm a huge foodie :yum:

Follow me and my journey!
